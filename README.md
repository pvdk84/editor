=== GENERAL ===

My own custom-made programming editor.

I want it to be as basic and simple as possible, not the fancy stuff of auto-completion and highlighting and so on. Just text, plain and simple. 

It should look very plain and simple, much like Mac's TextEdit, but with a Matrix/Darcula kind of style: green text against black background.

=== FEATURES ===

"file" menu: open, save, new (keyboard shortcuts)

"edit" menu: cut, copy, paste (keyboard shortcuts)

tabs for different open files

line numbering

key-bindings: (see notepad++)
- cut, copy, paste: 
- find: ctrl f
- duplicate line: ctrl d
- delete line: ctrl y
- move line up:  
- move line down:
