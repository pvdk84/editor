Just a simple editor to get acquainted with javaFX.

Features:
- file menu with options "open", "save", and "new"

Maybe turn it into my own customized coding editor sometime, with: 
- tabs for different open files on the top
- overview directory on the left
- line numbering
- find function
- duplicate, delete line
- move line up, down
- comment out
