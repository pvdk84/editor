Just a simple editor to get acquainted with javaFX.

Features:
- file menu: open, save, new
- edit menu: cut, copy, paste

Maybe turn it into my own customized coding editor sometime: 
- tabs for different open files
- line numbering
- find function
- duplicate, delete line
- move line up, down
- comment out
